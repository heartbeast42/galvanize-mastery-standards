* Solve a logic puzzle using the Polyá method and take a photo of the solution
* Write a paragraph about the solution and how you went about finding it.

See screenshots for the problem I solved and the solution

Here are my Polya notes
* Understand the problem
  * This is a grid logic problem, where multiple elements must be coordinated in order to solve it correctly

* Devise a plan
  * read all the available information and hints and see if there is anything that jumps out as obvious.
  * once one deduction has been made reread the information again and see if another deduction can be made from the new information that was just deduced.

* Carry out the plan
  *

* Reflect
